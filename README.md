# Avatar Image Generator App

You can find the deployed web app at https://avatar-image-generator.herokuapp.com/

This app allows you to create a virtual avatar based on your appearance. Just upload a picture of your face, crop it, and you're done!

This is a demo of [our project](https://madewithml.com/projects/1233/generating-avatars-from-real-life-pictures/) created for the Made With ML Data Science Incubator.
If you would like to check the model code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Leinadh/avatar-image-generator)!
